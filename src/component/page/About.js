      data entry is done by touching the screen,
      and many new laptops are equipped with this technology.
      However, it is not possible to enter information and control
      older desktop and laptop systems with a stylus or touch screen.
      For this purpose, Microsoft has registered a new patent and offers touch
      control (touch) for laptops without touch screen. The patent can control
      a part of the screen, such as touch screens, using an external computer touch device or touchpad.
